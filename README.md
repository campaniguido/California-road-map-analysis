Campani-Califonia_road_map.pdf: it contains the report of the complex network analysis of the californian road. 
                                             In the file introduction there is a briefly explanation of all the data analysis procedure.
                                             
roadnet-ca.txt: it contains couples of numbers representing couples of conected roads

main.py: it contains the code useful to read the file roadnet-ca.tx, deleting some bugs in the dataset,
                  to make plots/histograms of the main features of the whole/reduced graph and
                  to visualize the features distribution
ERG.py: it contains the code useful to create an Erdos-RÃ©ny graph with a linkg probability equal to the one of a the roadnet
                  and to make plots/histograms of the main features of this graph
                  
Copycat.py: it contains the code useful to create a network which try to copy the features distribution of a given network.
                     and to make plots/histograms of the main features of this copynetwork.
                     
         
                  
function.py: contains all the function used in the three .py files and it also contains the tests of the functions

The libraries used are: math, matplotlib, networkx, numpy, pandas, pytest, random.
